# MindfullNest

### What?
MindfullNest is a webapp that allows hosting mindfullness classes. For example one may want to host a `Meditation for beginners` class. They can easily set it up and get others to join (and, in future, pay) class online.

### Why?
* We feel there's a lack of solution like this focused on mindfullness
* In our opinion mindfullness is an important part of mental wellbeing, which, globally, is quite low
* Due to COVID situation many people are left without offline mindfullness classes, MindfullNest could help them
* We wanted to learn some Phoenix LiveView and make webapp with minimum JS possible :wink:

### To run app locally

* Install deps with `mix deps.get`
* Use `mix ecto.setup` for database creation, migration and seeding
* Install frontend deps by running `npm install --prefix assets`
* Start app with `mix phx.server`

**OR**
